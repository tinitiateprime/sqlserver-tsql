SQL Server doesn't support the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW syntax like Oracle.
Instead, Indexed Views serve as SQL Serverâ€™s Materialized View equivalent.

How? âž” Once you create a unique clustered index on a view, SQL Server materializes (stores) the result physically on disk and keeps it updated when the underlying table changes.

Example Using EMP Table in SQL Server
Letâ€™s create a summary materialized view that stores employee count and average salary by department.

* Step 1: Create the View with SCHEMABINDING
```sql
CREATE VIEW employees.vw_emp_summary
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT deptno,
       COUNT_BIG(*) AS emp_count,  -- COUNT_BIG() is required
       AVG(CAST(sal AS FLOAT)) AS avg_sal
FROM employees.emp
GROUP BY deptno;

```

* Step 2: Create a Unique Clustered Index (Materializing the View)
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_vw_emp_summary
ON employees.vw_emp_summary(deptno);
```
âœ… After this step, the view is materialized â€” the result set is physically stored and auto-updated when the emp table changes.

âœ… Query the Materialized View
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees.vw_emp_summary;
```

âœ… Summary Example (Materialized View on EMP table)
```sql

-- Materialized view equivalent
CREATE VIEW employees.vw_emp_summary
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT deptno, COUNT_BIG(*) AS emp_count, AVG(CAST(sal AS FLOAT)) AS avg_sal
FROM employees.emp
GROUP BY deptno;
```

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_vw_emp_summary
ON employees.vw_emp_summary(deptno);
```
âœ… Now SQL Server stores the result like a materialized view and keeps it updated automatically.
