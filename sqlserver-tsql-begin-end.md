##### [Back To Context](./README.md)
We are declaring and initializing variables, performing a simple addition operation, and then printing and selecting the result. Here's a breakdown of the script

Variable Declaration and Initialization:

@num1 is declared as an integer and initialized to 1.
@num2 is declared as an integer without an initial value.
@res is declared as an integer to store the result of the addition.
Setting Variable Values:

@num2 is set to 20 using the SET statement.
Performing Addition:

The sum of @num1 and @num2 is calculated and stored in @res.
Printing Results:

The script prints the string 'Sum of Num1 and Num2'.
It then prints 'Sum: ' followed by the sum, which is cast to a varchar for concatenation with the string.
The sum is also printed directly as an integer.
Finally, the SELECT statement is used to display the result in the query result window.

begin
    declare @num1 int = 1;  -- Variable = container
    declare @num2 int;
    declare @res int;
    
    -- set @num1 = 10; 
    set @num2 = 20;

    set @res = @num1 + @num2;
    print 'Sum of Num1 and Num2';
    print  'Sum: ' + cast(@res as varchar);
    print  @res;
    select @res;

end;
```

* Below script demonstrates variable declaration, initialization, reassignment, and basic arithmetic operations. Here``s a step-by-step explanation:

**Variable Declaration and Initialization:**

@data1 is declared as an integer and initialized to 1.
@data2 is declared as an integer without an initial value.
Setting Variable Values:

@data2 is set to 10 using the SET statement, and its value is printed, which will be 10.
Reassigning Variable Values:

@data2 is then reassigned to 20, and its new value is printed, which will be 20.
Performing Arithmetic and Printing Results:

The script prints the result of adding 10 to @data2, which will be 30.
It then prints the value of @data2 again, which remains 20, demonstrating that the addition in the previous step did not change the value of @data2.

```sql 
-- Variables Code blocks
-- -------------------------
begin
    declare @data1 int = 1; -- variable declare and initialize
    declare @data2 int;     -- variable declare
    
    set @data2 = 10;  -- variable initialize
    print @data2;  -- 10

    set @data2 = 20;  -- variable re-assign
    print @data2;  -- 20

    print @data2+10; -- 30
    print @data2;    -- 20
end;

```
